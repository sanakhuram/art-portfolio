### *A personal world of miniature art, color, and front-end development*

Welcome to my **Art Illustration Portfolio** — a deeply personal project where I merged my love for traditional miniature painting with my passion for modern front-end development.
Every page, color, stroke, animation, and layout is crafted with intention — slow, immersive, emotional, and full of story.

## 🌈 My Immersive Color Philosophy

I created an **immersive color palette** inspired by:

* pigment grinding & traditional paint rituals
* Mughal, Persian, Greek & Norse motifs
* earthy browns, mist tones, and soft light
* Nordic minimalism
* the quiet, meditative feeling of miniature art

The goal was to build a digital world that **feels painted**, not just coded.
Warm, soft, detailed — like holding a tiny story in your hands.
