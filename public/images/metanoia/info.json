  "title": "Metanoia",
  "concept": "Metanoia is the turning of the soul—a slow, deliberate shift from the darkness we grow accustomed to toward the light we secretly long for. When one lives in shadows for too long, the darkness begins to feel like home; it wraps itself around the heart until it becomes a quiet prison. Yet every longing soul carries a spark that refuses to die. Roses unravel like layers of the self, butterflies signal rebirth, and gold leaf marks sacred moments of divine intervention. This series traces that inner journey: the struggle, the waiting, the surrender, and finally the reawakening. It is patience, reflection, breaking, healing—and ultimately, becoming.",
