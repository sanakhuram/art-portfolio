  "title": "Mythological Illustrations",
  "description": "A series shaped by ancient belief and the whispered memory of folklore. These works draw from Nordic spirits, Greek tragedies, Roman omens, and South Asian oral traditions. Each painting becomes a small theatre of myth—where devotion, sacrifice, and transformation blur between the natural and the divine. The pieces are layered in watercolor, gouache, and gold, continuing the miniature tradition while weaving in a contemporary sense of silence, symbolism, and atmospheric depth.",

      "description": "From the forests of Tiveden comes the tale of Fagertärn, where the lilies bloom red. A fisherman once bargained with the nøkken, promising his daughter in exchange for plentiful catches. When her eighteenth year arrived, she walked to the lake—not to surrender, but to choose her fate. She pierced her heart and fell into the water, turning the lilies crimson. The painting captures this quiet defiance, where sacrifice becomes legend and beauty is born of grief."
